## Monika
Created a Unpivoting Data Table with Subtotals. 

This Data table contained information from the top 7 car models which are Pruis, Camry, Sienna, Yaris, Corolla, Rav4, and Tacoma. I looked at the different repair costs and comparing whether the repairs are Minor, Major or Extreme. I transformed and pivoted the table as needed to extract the data needed. 

## Alireza
